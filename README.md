#Chris Duhaime Portfolio

## Portfolio Summary

## In my portfolio I tried to be as Semantic as possible by using element tags like <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>.  I was able to link several <img> tags properly into different areas of the HTML as desired.  I was also able to link my external CSS stylesheet to my HTML properly.  I tried to keep my HTML and CSS ordered and spaced properly with proper parent children relationships.  I was able to play around with a variety of CSS attributes and values to try and make the webpage appear presentable.  I created a <nav> bar in the <header> and linked properly to appropriate sections of the webpage and to an external LinkedIn resume in a new tab.  I struggled with some positioning and trying to make the website with a responsive design.  I was able to sticky position the <header> so that stayed in view.
